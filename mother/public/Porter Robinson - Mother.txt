Until I study the shape of your face
Take what you give
I only wanna do what's good for you

[?]
I'm checking the doors in my way
I can't keep my hands from my face
I said "Mom, I'm so sorry"
She smiled and said "Darling, I don't want you to worry, cause

I'm on your side for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone, don't you worry my child
And though there's an empty room you outgrew
I'll be here for you, oh"

And I've known
The feeling you've had [?]

"I'm on your side for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone, don't you worry my child
And though there's an empty room you outgrеw
I'll be here for you, oh
I'm on your sidе for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone, don't you worry my child
And though there's an empty room you outgrew
I'll wait for you, oh

I'm on your side for the rest of your life
You'll never be alone, don't you worry my child
And though there's an empty room you outgrew
I'll be here for you, oh"
