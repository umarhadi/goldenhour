[00:05]..
[00:08]The child I was
[00:15]counting the days til the summer would come
[00:16]but
[00:19]you don't live forever,
[00:27]your mother will one day bring you home.

and I feel so stupid,
cus I wasn't scared of this before
But since I met you,
I don't wanna die no more

So take a long time, 
cus oh, the world is lucky to be your home
I know
I need a next life, cus I'm not satisfied to know you just once

So take a long time, 
cus oh, the world is lucky to be your home
I know
I need a next life - 
not satisfied to know you just once

To live with dying,
wouldn't you see our world as dark?
But I won't spend time resenting the way things are

So take a long time, 
oh, the world is lucky to be your home
I know
I need a next life - not satisfied to know you just once

So take a long time, 
cus oh, the world is lucky to be your home
I know
I need a next life - 
not satisfied to know you just once
So take a long time, 
cus oh, the world is lucky to be your home
I know
I need a next life - 
not satisfied to know you just once

And I won't spend time resenting the way things are
